## gti_gcp_visionapi_java
This repo is used as exploration of [GCP Vision Java Client API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/libraries)

## Initialization

### Setting up authorization
To run the client library, you must first set up authentication by creating a service account and setting an environment variable. Complete the following steps to set up authentication. For other ways to authenticate, see the [GCP authentication documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).

Provide authentication credentials to your application code by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. Replace `**[PATH]**` with the file path of the JSON file that contains your service account key. This variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again:
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```
For example:
```console
# export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="`pwd`/just4fun-164308-6dd7cc07d90
# env | grep GOOGLE
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/root/Github/gti_gcp_visionapi_java/just4fun-164308-6dd7cc07d900.json
```
